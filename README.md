## The game

In this hybrid between a board and card game you take control over an army of combat-ready gummy bears with only one goal in mind: Defeat the enemy side and protect the king's honor. Fight friends and foes in team-based online battles with up to 8 players and show them who's the real tactician on the board!

Stay tuned for an incoming release on itch.io and Steam!

## The project

As part of my studies in media informatics two colleagues and me were tasked with creating a competitive multiplayer game experience that can both be conceptualized and programmed over the span of just a single semester. Right from the very first brainstorm sessions we already had a clear vision in our head and following the positive feedback from our lecturers and fellow students we continued work way beyond the originally planned schedule and are now aiming for a public release on Steam and itch.io within the near future.
